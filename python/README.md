## US Stroke Mortality Data Exploration

According to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), someone in the United States has a stroke every 40 seconds. And every 4 minutes, someone dies of stroke. This might be a shock for some, but stroke is one of the leading causes of death among US adults.

First of all, what is a stroke exactly? In simple terms, a stroke occurs when the blood supply to your brain (or part of it) is reduced or completely interrupted. This stops brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients, causing its cells begin to die in a matter of minutes. Symptoms that may indicate that someone is having a stroke include numbness of face, arms or legs, headache as well as trouble speaking, undesrtanding and walking.

Based on data published by the CDC, the rate of death due to stroke in 2012 to 2014 among US adults (35+ years) was

<p style="text-align: center"> <b> 70.9 per 100,000 people </b> </p>

Now lets dive deeper in the data available. Further analysis can be read in [this notebook](https://eu-de.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/a95489c9-d4fb-4d58-8348-1798c62d5c66/view?access_token=1ae4b2d129aa3ed2584b6af8a74a1e80822c974baf09d8468e2574758628a960)

The US states with the highest mortality rate are located in the Southeartern Region of the country. Top 7 states include:
1. Alabama (with a rate of 94.3 per 100,00)
2. Mississipi
3. Arkansas
4. South Carolina

This geographical correlation can be explained because this region features the highest concentrations of people living with risk factors associated with strokes, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and smoking.
