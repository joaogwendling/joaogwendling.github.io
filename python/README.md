## US Stroke Mortality Data Exploration

According to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), **someone in the United States has a stroke every 40 seconds**. And every 4 minutes, someone dies of stroke. This might be a shock for some, but stroke is one of the **leading causes of death** among US adults.

First of all, **what is a stroke** exactly? In simple terms, a stroke occurs when the **blood supply to your brain** (or part of it) is **reduced or completely interrupted**. This stops brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients, causing its cells begin to die in a matter of minutes. Symptoms that may indicate that someone is having a stroke include numbness of face, arms or legs, headache as well as trouble speaking, undesrtanding and walking.

Based on data published by the CDC, the rate of death due to stroke in 2012 to 2014 among US adults (35+ years) was

<p style="text-align: center"><strong> 70.9 per 100,000 people </strong></p>

Now lets dive deeper in the data available. Further analysis can be read in [this notebook](https://eu-de.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/a95489c9-d4fb-4d58-8348-1798c62d5c66/view?access_token=1ae4b2d129aa3ed2584b6af8a74a1e80822c974baf09d8468e2574758628a960).

The US states with the highest mortality rate are **located in the Southeartern Region** of the country. 
**Top 7 states** include:
1. Alabama (with a rate of 94.3 per 100,000)
2. Mississipi
3. Arkansas
4. South Carolina
5. Tennessee
6. West Virginia
7. Louisiana

This geographical correlation can be explained because this region features the **highest concentrations of people living with risk factors** associated with strokes, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and smoking. [Source](https://drexel.edu/now/archive/2017/February/Stroke-Risk-Factors-Most-Prevalent-in-Southeast-US/). The cause of this region being associated with this factors is still to be discovered.

Still, there are US counties that did not register any death caused by stroke in the years of the study. From the total of around three thousand counties, **26 of them did not register any stroke deaths**. Most of these counties are located in Alaska and Nebraska.

**Men tend to die by stroke more** than women. The national stroke mortality rate differs slighty, as female stroke mortality is 69.3 per 100,000 and male is 71.6. Various factors, such as hormones, coagulation, genetics, social interactions, and lifestyle might independently or together help to explain gender differences in stroke.

Another interesting insight taken from the dataset is race and ethnicity difference in stroke mortality.

As seen in the previous graph, **black people are more likely to die from having a stroke**, compared to other ethnicities. The rate of death by stroke among black americans is significantly higher than the national avarege (98.3 compared to 70.9).
This brings the question: why do black people die more from strokes?
According to the [American Stroke Association](https://www.stroke.org/-/media/stroke-files/lets-talk-about-stroke/prevention/lets-talk-about-black-americans-and-stroke-sheet.pdf?la=en#:~:text=Not%20all%20of%20the%20reasons,one%20risk%20factor%20for%20stroke%3A&text=High%20blood%20pressure%20%E2%80%93%20Over%20half,and%20is%20often%20more%20severe.), not all factors that may cause the black population to have an increased risk of stroke are clear, however, it is known that 2 out of 3 black americans have at least one risk factor for stroke, such as:
- High blood preassure
- Obesity/Overweight
- Diabetes
- High cholesterol
- Stress

Over half adult black americans have high blood preassure, and it is more severe that in other races. Combine this with the obesity/overweight prevalent in 80% of black women and 70% of black men, higher chances to have diabetes, high blood cholesterol, smoking habits and daily stress and you start to undestand this pattern we just discovered.
